<h2>A Bit About Muckraking</h2>
<article>
	<p>
		The term <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muckraker">'muckraker'</a></i> was first coined during the Progressive Era of the early 20th century. Muckrakers were investigative journalists who targeted government officials and corporations for their misdeeds and corruption. These journalists often called for sweeping reforms in the interest of protecting the public and workers.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Progressive Era and muckrakers rose in response to the excess and corruption of the Gilded Age during the late 19th century. Many people became concerned at how corporate monopolies were abusing workers, consumers, and the environment all while the government did nothing to stop these power grabs. How could a government allow its people to be at the mercy of for-profit institutions? Simple, the government itself had been bought by the very corporations they were charged with regulating.
		This should all start to sound familiar.
